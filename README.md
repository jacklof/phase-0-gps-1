## Commands used:
**git clone** - Downloaded the repository so we can make changes to it.
**touch** - Made a file to edit the content within.
**git status** - Check what stage the repository is in.
**git commit** - Created a savepoint to later merge.
**git push** - Put the remote repo changes on the master branch.
**git branch** - Get which branch we are currently on, and list the available ones.
**git checkout** - Switches to an available specified branch.

## Git stages:
* Unstaged: an untracked file. In order to track it use **git add**.
* Staged: having used **git add**, changes to be committed are shown in the terminal, showing what is to be done when **git commit** is invoked.
* Commit: finalize the changes, adding a clear message to detail what was changed at that point.

===

* Git tracks changes by having different statuses for each step in committing changes, as well as having the ability to make branches, or alternate versions of the repo.  

* Making changes involves having an unstaged change,  then adding specific changes to be committed, then committing.
