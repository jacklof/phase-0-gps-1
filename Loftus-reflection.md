*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*
I was struggling with remembering the correct workflow, when to push/pull/merge/etc.

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*
The workflow was really ironed out, cleared things up quite a bit.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*
I can't recall specific questions, other than establishing driver/navigator roles and making sure we were on the same page.

*What still confuses you about Git?*
I still get confused by solving merge conflicts. We had one come up outside of the reflection where we are supposed to induce one, and it took awhile to navigate around it.

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*
It was great! It was nice to have someone around in the beginning to help answer questions and the like. Working on a project together remotely is new to me, so it was a fun experience.
