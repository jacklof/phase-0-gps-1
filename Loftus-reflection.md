*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS Session?*  
I was struggling with keeping track of the proper workflow, when to use fetch, merge, or push/pull. 

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*
What the proper order is for git workflow.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*
Some syntax questions, questions related to commit messages, definitions, etc.

*What still confuses you about Git?*
What "remote" exactly means as an argument, as well as satisfying merge conflicts.

It was great! I like meeting new people, and being able to think through something with someone else is fantastic.
